3d Game

 -rpg game
 
 -oracle provides hints for quests 
 
 	- "i see you have dont quest A but person B needs their item still"
 	
 -main goal is adventuring but can do other things and need to keep house in running order, 
 	and maybe a job or something 

-fluid quests -  

	- eg: yu find a scrap of fir on the tree, there mus be some animals nearby. kill the animal
		find rare family treasure. you can choose to sell it, or find the owners
		instead of (there is a bear nearby, kill it and get the jewel and return it) etc

	- dont need specific area's to do quests, but time related quests. some quests should be completed in relative time
		eg if someone needs an umberella to go outside, or a pick to go mining, it should only take a day or
		two. if you return to the people they might have already found another (maybe consequences too if they dont)

	- quests are updated when the player is given more information, if someone asks you to go somewhere but
		when you return they arent there, you dont just automatically know where to go, you have to find a note, 
		or look around or something

	- no spoon feeding (all information only updated when player finds out) eg dragon at x only found out because
		someone fleeing from the village, or a scout found it and ran to the nearest village
	-
	
-information system

	- info only updates once you find something
		eg, map wont tell you where things are until you discover it (and then talk to someone
		who knows) or talk to someone about it and find its location 

	- you have to choose when to mark your map if you discover something, or buy sections from shops (not 100% 
		accurate)
